Dibujo is a drawing application with features like free drawing, rectangles, circles, and text input (can't change the size of the text yet). It also includes a color picker and supports background color changes. if you want to quickly show/draw something while screensharing or in person, you can quickly open this app via terminal and draw/write whatever you want to show/explain and close it easily with ```âŒ˜ + q``` and continue with your work.
